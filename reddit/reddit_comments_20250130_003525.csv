This may cost a lot at the start but it can last a month or so.

Ingredients:

- Dark soya sauce, not normal ones but dark. All you need it a little pinch and the flavors add punch. If you want that indome sweet soya sauce flavor. Then heat the sauce with a teaspoon or two of brown sugar until the sauce thickens.

- garlic and onion paste or powder. Fresh ingredients are better but it's take lotta time.

- chili oil (chili flakes, sesame oil, garlic, onions, ginger, seasonings). Heat the oil in low flame with onions, garlic, star anise, cloves. Let it simmer until the flavors incorporate with the oil, on a separate heat proof bowl, add in the chili flakes, and pour the hot oil through a shiv filtering the ingredients from it. You can add in chipped garlic and ginger for extra taste.

- chicken cubes for broth. Make sure to only a little section of the cube for one serving.",3,2024-07-09,False
